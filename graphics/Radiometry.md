# Radiometry

## Some basics

- Solid angle: Solid angle in 3D is just a section of a sphere.
- Radiometric units:  
  - Energy $Q$, in Joules.($J$)
  - Power or flux: $P$ or $\phi$, in watts($W = J/s$). Power can be seen as the derivative of energy. $Q = \frac{dQ}{dt}$
  - Flux area density. $E = \frac{d\phi}{dA}$
  - Flux solid angle density. $I = \frac{d\phi}{d\omega}$
  - Flux density. $L(x, \omega) = \frac{d^2\phi}{dAd\omega}$
